YAML, JSOn and XML are often compared because they can all be used to storedata in a structured manner.

Yaml can contain comments 

Yaml is often used for writing configuration files because of it's readability and simiplicity

Yaml in Python

Python can easily interact with YAML using libraries like PyYAML

Example.

How to load yaml file to python?

import yaml

with open('config.yaml', 'r) as file:
    config = yaml.safe_load(file)

print(config)

This Python script reads a YAML file and convert it into a python dictnory


Yaml is case sensitive

it uses indentation to represent hierarchical relationships between elements.
A colon (:) separates key-value pairs.

Use a dash (-) for list items.

Scalars are the simplest Datatypes in Yaml

Sequences are equivalent to lists and arrays.

A dash(-) denotes a Sequences item.

Example.

hobbies:
  - Reading
  - Cycling
  - Gaming


Mappings

Mapping are key-value pairs, like dictionaries or Hashes.

A colon (:) separates each key from its value.

Example:

student:
  name: "John Doe"
  age: 20

Complex Structures

YAML can represent Complex nested data structures using a combination of mapings and Sequences

Example:

employees:
  - name: "Najumudeen M"
    skills:
      - Python
      - YAML
  - name: "Zayan"
    skils:
      - English
      - Hindi

YAML Types:

Anchors
Alias
Tag

Anchors (represented with &) allow you to label content for later reuse.

Alias (represented with *) allow you to refer back to anchored content.

Anchor and Aliases are powerful tools for reducing duplication and increasing YAML file maintainability.

example:

default: &DEFAULT 
  name: "Najumudeen M"
  age: 44

user1: 
  <<: *DEFAULT
  name: "Najumudeen M"


Tag in YAML provide a way to speciofy the type of a node.
they are used to explicity decale a node's tyoe or the use a cusiotme data
Types
integer: !!int "5"
string: !!str 5

 Here, Integer will be represent as an integer, while 'string' will be interpreted as a string, despite the quoted "5";
